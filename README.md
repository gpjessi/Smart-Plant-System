# Smart Plant System

This is a prototype project designed to monitor the health of a basil plant using real-time environmental data. The system uses sensors to track **soil moisture**, **light intensity**, and **temperature/humidity**, all connected to an ESP32 microcontroller.

The goal is to create an **affordable and accessible AgriTech solution** for home growers, students, and small-scale farmers interested in sustainable, data-informed plant care.


# Features

- Live sensor monitoring (moisture, light, temperature/humidity)
- Open-source web interface (planned)
- Future integration with AI for prediction/alerts
- Educational and scalable model for food justice
